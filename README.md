## Project Synopsis

`fin-health` is an interactive dashboard that visualizes the financial health of publicly traded companies. It allows users to explore key financial metrics such as revenue, profitability, debt ratios, and cash flow across companies and time periods. fin-health supports investors and analysts in making data-driven comparisons and evaluating corporate financial performance across sectors and time.

## Motivation
Investment analysts and portfolio managers often need to compare financial performance across sectors and individual companies to support data-driven investment decisions. However, extracting insights from financial statements typically requires manually compiling data and creating ad-hoc visualizations, a process that can be both time-consuming and prone to errors.

`fin-health` addresses this challenge by providing a centralized, interactive dashboard that enables users to explore financial performance efficiently. By allowing users to filter data by time period, sector, and financial metrics, the dashboard facilitates rapid analysis of profitability trends, peer benchmarking, and key financial indicators.

## Demo

Below is a short preview of the dashboard interface.

## Features

- **Sector Analysis** — Compare profitability metrics across sectors with interactive charts and peer benchmarking
- **Company Health** — Deep dive into individual company financials with KPIs, ratio trends, and cash flow charts
- **AI Explorer** — Filter and explore the dataset using natural language powered by LLM (querychat)
