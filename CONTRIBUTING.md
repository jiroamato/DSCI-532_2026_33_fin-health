# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome here, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Example Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, for example:

* [Report bugs](#report-bugs)
* [Fix Bugs](#fix-bugs)
* [Implement Features](#implement-features)
* [Write Documentation](#write-documentation)
* [Submit Feedback](#submit-feedback)

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at <https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_33_fin-health/issues>.

**If you are reporting a bug, please follow the template guidelines. The more
detailed your report, the easier and thus faster we can help you.**

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything labelled with `bug` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. When you decide to work on such an issue, please assign yourself to it and add a comment that you'll be working on that, too. If you see another issue without the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything labelled with
`enhancement` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. As
for [fixing bugs](#fix-bugs), please assign yourself to the issue and add a comment that you'll be working on that, too. If another enhancement catches your fancy, but it doesn't have the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Write Documentation

fin-health could always use more documentation, whether as
part of the official documentation, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog
posts, articles, and such. Just
[open an issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_33_fin-health/issues)
to let us know what you will be working on so that we can provide you with guidance.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
<https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_33_fin-health/issues>. If your feedback fits the format of one of the issue templates, please use that. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project and everybody has limited time.

## Git Workflow

We use a branching workflow based on GitHub Flow. Here's how it works:

### Branch Structure

```
main
 └── develop
      ├── feature/feature-name
      │    └── test/feature-name
      └── fix/bug-name
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **`main` branch**: The stable, production-ready branch. Only receives merges from `develop` after milestone completion.

2. **`develop` branch**: The integration branch where all features and fixes are merged. Branched from `main`.

3. **Feature branches**: For new features, branch from `develop`:

   ```bash
   git switch develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Fix branches**: For bug fixes, branch from `develop`:

   ```bash
   git switch develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b fix/bug-name
   git push origin fix/bug-name
   ```

5. **Test branches**: For writing tests, branch from your feature branch:

   ```bash
   git switch feature/your-feature-name
   git checkout -b test/your-feature-name
   git push origin test/your-feature-name
   ```

   When tests are complete, create a PR from `test/your-feature-name` → `feature/your-feature-name`.

6. **Merging back**: Once your feature is complete (code + tests), create a PR from `feature/your-feature-name` → `develop`.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally before creating a PR
2. Request review from at least one team member
3. Address all review comments before merging
4. After approval, merge and delete the feature branch

## Developer Setup

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up fin-health for
local development.

1. Fork the <https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_33_fin-health>
   repository on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally (*if you want to work locally*)

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/DSCI-532_2026_33_fin-health.git
    ```

3. Create and activate the conda environment

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate fin-health
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development using the default branch (typically `main`) as a starting point. Use `fix` or `feature` as a prefix for your branch name.

    ```shell
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b fix-name-of-your-bugfix
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

2. When you're done making changes, apply the quality assurance tools and check that your changes pass our test suite. This is all included with tox.

    ```shell
    hatch run test:run
    ```

3. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub. Please use [semantic
   commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix: summarize your changes"
    git push -u origin fix-name-of-your-bugfix
    ```

4. Open the link displayed in the message when pushing your new branch in order to submit a pull request.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. Your pull request will automatically be checked by the full test suite. It needs to pass all of them before it can be considered for merging.
