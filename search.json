The more detailed your report, the easier and thus faster we can help you.\n\n\n\nLook through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything labelled with bug and help wanted is open to whoever wants to implement it. When you decide to work on such an issue, please assign yourself to it and add a comment that you’ll be working on that, too. If you see another issue without the help wanted label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.\n\n\n\nLook through the GitHub issues for features.

If your feedback fits the format of the Peer Review template, please use that. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project and everybody has limited time.\n\n\n\n\nWe use a branching workflow based on GitHub Flow.
